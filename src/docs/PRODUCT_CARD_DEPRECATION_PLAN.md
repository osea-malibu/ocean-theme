# Product Card Deprecation Plan

## What Deprecation Entails

Deprecation is the process of marking the old `product-card.liquid` as obsolete while keeping it available for other theme branches that may still depend on it. This is a safer approach than deletion.

## Deprecation Strategy

### Phase 1: Mark as Deprecated (Current State)

- ✅ Keep `product-card.liquid` in the codebase
- ✅ Add deprecation notice to the file
- ✅ Document migration path
- ✅ Monitor usage across branches

### Phase 2: Soft Deprecation (After Testing)

- Add deprecation warnings in development
- Create migration documentation
- Notify team members

### Phase 3: Hard Deprecation (Future)

- Remove from new features
- Require explicit opt-in to use old snippet
- Eventually remove after all branches migrate

## Implementation

### 1. Add Deprecation Notice to product-card.liquid

```liquid
{% comment %}
  DEPRECATED: This snippet is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

  MIGRATION: Use one of the new specialized product card snippets instead:
  - product-card-basic.liquid: Simple product display
  - product-card-with-variants.liquid: Products with variant pickers
  - product-card-compact.liquid: Compact grid layout
  - product-card-featured.liquid: Enhanced styling with reviews/benefits
  - product-card-pdp-link.liquid: Links to product detail page

  This snippet is preserved for backward compatibility with other theme branches.
  New sections should use the appropriate specialized snippet.
{% endcomment %}
```

### 2. Create Migration Documentation

- Document which new snippet to use for each use case
- Provide migration examples
- List breaking changes

### 3. Monitor Usage

- Track which branches still use the old snippet
- Identify migration blockers
- Plan removal timeline

## Benefits of This Approach

### ✅ Safety

- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Other branches continue to work
- Gradual migration path

### ✅ Flexibility

- Teams can migrate at their own pace
- New features use modern snippets
- Old features continue working

### ✅ Documentation

- Clear migration path
- Examples for each use case
- Breaking changes documented

## Migration Timeline

### Immediate (Current)

- [x] Create new specialized snippets
- [x] Update sections to use new snippets
- [x] Test all updated sections
- [x] Add deprecation notice

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)

- [ ] Add deprecation warnings in development
- [ ] Create comprehensive migration guide
- [ ] Notify development team
- [ ] Monitor usage across branches

### Medium Term (1-2 months)

- [ ] Migrate remaining sections
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Consider removal timeline

### Long Term (3+ months)

- [ ] Remove old snippet after all branches migrate
- [ ] Clean up any remaining references

## Risk Mitigation

### Before Deprecation

- [x] Comprehensive testing of new snippets
- [x] Backward compatibility verification
- [x] Performance impact assessment

### During Deprecation

- [ ] Monitor for regressions
- [ ] Track migration progress
- [ ] Provide support for migration

### After Deprecation

- [ ] Validate all functionality works
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Archive old snippet for reference

## Communication Plan

### Internal Team

- [ ] Announce deprecation timeline
- [ ] Provide migration training
- [ ] Set up support channels

### Documentation

- [ ] Update developer documentation
- [ ] Create migration examples
- [ ] Document breaking changes

### Monitoring

- [ ] Track snippet usage
- [ ] Monitor for issues
- [ ] Gather feedback

## Success Metrics

### Migration Progress

- [ ] Number of sections migrated
- [ ] Number of branches updated
- [ ] Time to complete migration

### Quality Metrics

- [ ] No regressions in functionality
- [ ] Improved performance
- [ ] Better maintainability

### Developer Experience

- [ ] Faster development with specialized snippets
- [ ] Easier debugging
- [ ] Better code organization
