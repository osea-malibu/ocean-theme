We are not responsible for any injury or damage that may result from services or products purchased past their expiration date or those that have been altered or discontinued.<br><br><br>\n<b>AUTO-RENEWAL PROGRAMS</b><br>\nIf you are purchasing our services or products and enrolling in one of our auto-renewal programs in which you have requested that we automatically provide services or products to you at regularly scheduled times (the “Program”), your membership in the Program will remain in effect until cancelled.  When you place your first order and enroll in the Program, you will have the opportunity to select an interval for the timing of each order.  However, you may change the interval at any time, and you may opt to skip orders.  We will email you in advance of shipping each order to remind that we will be charging your payment method.<br><br>\nIf you sign up for the Program on the Site in connection with your purchases, the manner of payment you provide, including but not limited to a payment card, will be automatically charged for the purchase price of the products, plus applicable tax, shipping, and handling charges. You must provide current, complete, and accurate information for your shipping and billing accounts.  You are responsible for ensuring this information is correct and must promptly update all information to keep your account current, complete, and accurate (for example, to reflect changes in shipping or billing address, credit card number, credit card expiration date, and security code).  Shipments sent to the address of record are deemed complete upon shipment; we are not responsible for your failure to receive a shipment sent to your address of record in the event you have moved or for any other reason.  You must promptly notify OSEA if your credit card or alternative payment method is cancelled or no longer valid (for example, due to theft or loss).

By participating in the Program, you agree that we may send you additional regularly scheduled shipments and charge you for the product(s), applicable taxes, and shipping and handling charges, WITHOUT OBTAINING ANOTHER PAYMENT AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU.  These subsequent charges will be placed on the payment card or alternative payment method you provided when you enrolled in the Program or update thereafter.

THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND OSEA.

You agree that we will not be liable for any termination of your use of or access to the Site. <br><br><br>\n<b>NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES</b><br>\nWe and you are the only parties entitled to enforce these Terms.  These Terms do not and are not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than you and OSEA.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that the payment card networks are third party beneficiaries of these Terms for purposes of enforcing provisions relating to payments, but that their consent or agreement is not necessary for any changes or modifications to these Terms.  You also agree that if we assign, transfer, or sub-contract any of our rights or obligations under these Terms to any third party in writing, such third party may enforce the Terms that are assigned, transferred, or sub-contracted.  <br><br><br><b>\nDISPUTE RESOLUTION</b><br>\nAGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE AND WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS<br><br>\nWE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM, OR CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO OUR SERVICES, PRODUCTS, THESE TERMS, INCLUDING OUR PRIVACY POLICY AND COOKIE POLICY, OR THE BREACH, TERMINATION, ENFORCEMENT, INTERPRETATION, OR VALIDITY THEREOF OR THE USE OF THE SERVICES OR CONTENT AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE SITE (COLLECTIVELY, “DISPUTES”) WILL BE SETTLED BY CONFIDENTIAL BINDING ARBITRATION, EXCEPT THAT each party retains the right to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; and (ii) seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademark, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii) an “IP Protection Action”).  The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action will be the state and federal courts located in Los Angeles, California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.  <br><br>\nYou acknowledge and agree that both you and OSEA are waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class representative or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.  Further, unless we both otherwise agree in writing, an arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.  If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void.  Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive termination of these Terms.<br><br>\nWe both agree that these Terms should be interpreted and enforced under the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1, et seq.) because they memorialize a transaction in interstate commerce.  This section will survive termination of these Terms.<br><br><br><b>\nARBITRATION RULES</b><br>\nThe arbitration will be administered and governed by the Comprehensive or Expedited Arbitration Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (JAMS), whichever is appropriate and in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (the “JAMS Procedures”), which are available at http://www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267.  \nThe parties expressly agree that JAMS may not administer any multiple claimant or class arbitration, as the parties agree that the arbitration will be limited to the resolution of individual claims only.<br><br><br><b>\nDISPUTE NOTICE AND ARBITRATION PROCESS</b><br>\nPrior to initiating an arbitration proceeding, you must first send OSEA a written statement setting forth your name, address, and telephone number, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and the relief requested (“Dispute Statement”).  The Dispute Statement to OSEA must be emailed to support@oseamalibu.com.  If we are unable to resolve your claim within thirty (30) days, then either party that desires to initiate an arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the JAMS Procedures.  <br><br>\nAn arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve all Disputes relating to OSEA’s services and products, as well as all Disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to, the arbitrability of any claim, as well as any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable.  Notwithstanding this broad delegation of authority to the JAMS arbitrator, a court may determine the limited question of whether a claim or cause of action is an IP Protection Action.<br><br><br>\n<b>ARBITRATION LOCATION AND PROCEDURE</b><br>\nUnless the parties otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.  If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then: (i) the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents the parties submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary; and (ii) if there is a hearing, you may choose whether to participate in person or by telephone.  If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the JAMS Procedures.  Subject to the JAMS Procedures, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration.<br><br><br><b>\nARBITRATOR’S DECISION</b><br>\nThe arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions of law upon which the arbitrator based the award.  Judgment on the arbitration may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction thereof.  The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Disclaimer of Warranties,” and “Limitations of Liability” sections above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.  If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.  OSEA will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.<br><br><br>\n<b>FEES</b><br>\nWe will pay or (if applicable) reimburse you for all JAMS filing, administration, and arbitration fees for any arbitration commenced by you or OSEA pursuant to the terms of this section.<br><br><br><b>\nTIME LIMIT FOR RESOLVING DISPUTES</b><br>\nThe parties agree that any cause of action either may have with respect to the Site or our services, products, and Content must be commenced within one (1) year after the Dispute arises, notwithstanding any statutes of limitations to the contrary.  Many states’ laws set statutes of limitations that are longer than one (1) year.  If you live in a state that has statutes of limitations that are longer than one (1) year, by agreeing to these Terms, you are agreeing to shorten the time you have to bring a claim.  This means that if you wait longer than one (1) year to initiate arbitration under this section, you will lose some or all rights you may have to any recovery, including the right to recover damages, in connection with a Dispute.<br><br>\nThe terms of this Dispute Resolution section survive any termination of these Terms.<br><br><br><b>\nRIGHT TO OPT-OUT OR REJECT FUTURE CHANGES TO DISPUTE RESOLUTION SECTION</b><br>\nYou may elect to opt-out (exclude yourself) from the final, binding, individual arbitration procedure or waiver of class and representative proceedings specified in this section by sending a written letter to OSEA, at 1795 Washington Way, Venice, CA 90291, or by email to support@oseamalibu.com, within thirty (30) days of your first visit to and use of the Site that specifies your: (i) name; (ii) mailing address; and (iii) request to be excluded from the final, binding, individual arbitration procedure or waiver of class and representative proceedings specified in this section.  In the event you opt-out consistent with the procedure set forth above, all other terms and conditions of these Terms will continue to apply.  If you do not so opt-out, then the terms of this “Dispute Resolution” section will apply. <br><br>\nNotwithstanding the provisions of “Changes to Terms of Use” section above, if OSEA changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted subsequent changes to the Terms), you may reject any such change by sending OSEA written notice (including by email to support@oseamalibu.com) within thirty (30) days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of our email to you notifying you of such change.  By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and OSEA in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).<br><br><br><b>\nGENERAL TERMS</b><br>\nThese Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between OSEA and you regarding the Site, Content, services, and products that may be provided on the Site, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between you and OSEA regarding the Content, services, or products provided on the Site.  If, for any reason, any provision of these Terms is deemed to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. <br><br> \nYou may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent.  Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms without such consent will be null and of no effect.  We may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction.  Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors, and permitted assigns.<br><br>\nAny notices or other communications provided by OSEA under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given:  (i) by OSEA via email; or (ii) by posting to the Site.  For notices made by email, the date of receipt will be deemed the date we transmit such notice.<br><br>\nOur failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.  The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of OSEA.  Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.<br><br>\nNothing in these Terms will be construed as creating a joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship between you and OSEA, and you do not have any authority to create any obligation on our behalf.<br><br><br>\n<b>CONTACT INFORMATION</b><br>\nIf you have any questions about these Terms, please contact OSEA at: 1795 Washington Way, Venice, CA 90291 or support@oseamalibu.com.",
